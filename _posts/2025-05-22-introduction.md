Hello All, You can call me Ken. I am a consulting startup guy who has been building with Rails since 2006. I work with domain experts to build products that delight customers and have built multiple commercial, ( money-making products ) from the ground up by myself. I paused development in 2019 but love the additions to Rails 7 and 8 as well as the general direction of Rails taking away from the need for coding in JS. I am focused on once again becoming a developer who embodies the ""Rails is a one developer framework" ethos though I am looking to do it with the help of AI pairs. AI might have limits at writing code on its own but it can make a great pair.

ðŸš€ What I Offer:



ðŸ‘­ help finding your initial demographic ( customer development )<br>
ðŸ“Š help finding the feature set that will engage that demographic ( product management )<br>
ðŸ§° help building that product quickly and solidly ( product development )<br>
ðŸª¤ SaaS & MVP Development â€“ From idea to product market fit<br>
ðŸ§± Architecture & Code Quality â€“ Code that is fixable, scalable, and extensible<br>
